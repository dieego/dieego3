<p id="test">If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p align="center">What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". <strong>And this
<em>applies even</em> more to the online world</strong>, than in regular
business.</p>

<p>You see, <b>anyone can become</b> an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't <i>involve start-up capital</i> or expensive equipment to
start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p><em>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
you do to avoid them?</em></p>

<h6>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h6>
------------------------------------------------

<p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
<p>retype the same old simple information.</p>

<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
communicating words quickly.</p>

<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility <a href="http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target="_blank" title="Программа tipepilot">http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot</a> , but
there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
available.</p>

<h4>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h4>


<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
own installed on your computer.</p>

<p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
through them afterwards and pull back any that have
been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

<p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for</p>
FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more. </p>
